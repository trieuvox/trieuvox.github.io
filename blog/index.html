                     <p>We may go between that desperate feeling and safely isolating ourselves, choosing to not think of the desire for a fulfilling relationship. It seems easier to numb out, deny or make excuses for the lack in our love life. Being single can feel difficult or tiring but thats not how it should be. It should be a blessing (especially if you are still young) because it is a great opportunity to enjoy life at its fullest, to discover yourself, to visit the most beautiful places with your friends and so on. You should be enjoying every second of it instead of solely focusing yourself with what you are missing. If you are constantly thinking about your ex or someone with whom you would want to be (but for some reason, you are not), if you are constantly anticipating meeting the right one, you are not doing it right.</p>                   
                    <p>Many of us think it is beyond our control, which is why we go about forcing ourselves into relationships or on people we think will give us what we want. When you are constantly expecting and waiting for something to happen, you are draining yourself of positive energy because you are investing your thoughts in the wrong things. When you stop chasing love, you will ultimately become free. You will no longer feel like a prisoner of your own mind because you will be busy enjoying the present. You will be busy occupying yourself with the most exciting things you have always wanted to try. Your spirit will be rejuvenated and you will ooze with happiness.</p>
                    
                    
                    <!-- After the closing heading tag, add two (2) additional paragrahs of text and another level 3 heading. -->
                    <p>Over a period of months, I would have these dreams where I'd be exerting an enormous amount of energy toward someone I was involved with, and the more I seemed to show up where he was, the more he would acknowledge me and disappear. It took me awhile to understand the message, because I was busy blaming him for his inability to actually show up consistently. Sometimes, girl friendships turn into babbling about men, dissatisfaction about your love life and similar because when you are constantly focused on one thing like chasing the love of your life, you become blind when it comes to your people. When you only think about one thing, your topics narrow and you stop enjoying the time you spend together. When you release your mind of everything that has something to do with love, your friendship bonds will get stronger.You will discover new ways of having fun and enjoying moments like never before. Your future adventures will get you closer to each other and you will have the time of your life.</p>                    
                    <p>We can look to someone who gives us so little, and blame them without looking at how we are overwhelming them with our need. We may think we're open, sharing or expressing ourselves honestly, but what we're really looking for is a response that says we're loved, valued and worth the investment.</p>
                    
                    <h3>We're not really sure what propels us, beyond the need to fill up some empty space, or an expectation.</h3>
                    
                    <!-- After the closing heading tag, add three (3) paragraphs of text. -->
                    <p>In order to see yourself happy you need to let go of the idea that only love can make you happy, a man is a key to your happiness. If even it was true there would have been more happy couples in the world. I know it gets lonely at times, but there is strength in finding solitude. Feeling lonely is a sign that you still feel things. Even though you think you are dying inside, it is not true. Stop chasing love. Love shouldn not be chased it should come to you. It is better to wait then to go after things that do not mean anything, which makes you nothing but desperate. Stop telling yourself that you are not lovable. Do not get into an unnamed relationship thinking they can complete you. Do not do that to yourself. All that sex you have to feel something is not going to bring love to you, it is going to shatter you in ways you never imagined. </p>
                    <P>Stop putting so much faith in that person that knows what you want but cannot give you that. Stop chasing him for the love he can never offer you. Stop giving him parts of you that he does not care to acknowledge. I know it is hard not to be cared about; I know you want to be loved back. Each time you offer yourself to him he is not capable of offering the same to you. So stop offering yourself. Let me tell you what you actually deserve. Everything! You deserve everything you ever wanted. You are lovable and you are capable of loving back. Think about the lonely nights you spent wallowing for love and crying over thinking you are going to end up alone. It is time now that you stop chasing love, it is the time that you make yourself great first, do justice to yourself and love yourself first. You will move on from the old wounds and you will find happiness. Be patient and explore yourself and the world.</P>
                    <h3>We aren't looking within as to our why, we're looking on the outside to fill the cracks and give us our value.</h3>
                    <p>Think about this just from an energetic standpoint as well. If you say, I really, really want you, I really, really would love having you around all the time, I really, really would just like you to come to dinner with me and I really, really would enjoy that. How does that feel? It feels desperate, and it feels like something that repels you. You're like, oh bro, I don't, not necessarily just kind of want to do my thing. I don't want that pressure, but you see that's what a lot of times we do even not just with relationships, to be honest with you, just with things in general. Anytime you say, I really, really would like to have money, is this really, really desperate energy and we're putting that energy out. Not aware that that's the reason we're not attracting what we want. There's a process that I talk about sometimes called Reality Transurfing. That's about decreasing importance. You put something on a pedestal, you then are glorifying it, and you're saying that that's not natural for your self-image and thinking about this from also a point of view of a character in a movie, let's use this metaphor. If you are running around trying to be the cameo in someone else's movie by chasing them, you are not the star of your own movie. You are a cameo in someone else's. They can feel that, and they want you just to let them do their leadership role. You might actually be a little bit annoying to them because they're in their lead master role, and here you are trucking along trying to be the cameo, trying to be the supporting role, trying to be just somebody in their movie and because that's the frame because that's the energy that's put out.</p>

                        The paradox is that by doing so, you will then put off a more attractive energy and then these things will all come to you because you have shifted the energy dynamic and I know there's probably been someone in your life that you've seen that energy example that I've used where when you switch the energy than someone, people just feel it off of you.

                    <p>Leonardo DiCaprio is not disposable. In a Christopher Nolan film like inception or something, you can't take his role out. It wouldn't be the same movie, but someone on the sideline, some little, some little person that makes a little entrance and then leaves, probably don't even think about that. The more you get to your core of that realization is, the more your life will begin to change.</p>

                    <p>Tom and Jerry was a great show, but it's over. Stop watching the reruns and stop chasing over and over and over again. And if you do realize you're doing it, but the moment you shift your energy, and you realize that you already have that which you are chasing is the moment you stop putting out that resistant energy. And it's also the moment that you stop creating that lack mentality. The moment you stop being the cameo and everyone else's movie and you start getting to your core neediness is one of the most unattractive qualities that people have and especially in relationships.</p>
